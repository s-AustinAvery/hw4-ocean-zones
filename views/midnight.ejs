    <h2>Midnight Zone (Bathypelagic Zone)</h2>
    <p>
        The Midnight Zone is shrouded in total darkness. Temperatures here are low, and the pressure is extreme.
        No sunlight reaches here, and the only illumination comes from bioluminescent organisms.
        Life in this realm often looks alien. Transparent predators, glowing lures, and creatures with adaptations for silence drift in endless night.

        <li>Life: Deep sea fish, giant squids, glowing jellyfish</li>
