  <h2>Deep Trenches (Hadalpelagic Zone)</h2>
  <p>
  The trenches are the deepest and most extreme environments in the ocean, 
  existing more than 6,000 meters below the surface. These deep cuts in the seafloor 
  are shaped by tectonic forces and experience pressures over a thousand times than that at sea level. 
  Despite the inhospitable conditions, remarkable life forms persist in this hidden, isolated world.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Depth: ~6,000-11,000+ m</li>
  <li>Light: None</li>
  <li>Life: Amphipods, snailfish, deep sea creatures adapted to extreme pressure</li>
</ul>
