  <h2>Abyss (Abyssal Zone)</h2>
  <p>
    The Abyss is an immense, cold, pitch black zone stretching across the ocean floor.
    Pressures are crushing and temperatures hover just above freezing.
    Only highly specialized organisms survive here. Slow moving scavengers, deep-sea worms, 
    and creatures that have evolved to make the most of the scarce recources and complete darkness.

    <li>Depth: ~4,000-6,000 m</li>
    <li>Light: None</li>
    <li>Life: Sea cucumbers, tube worms, amphipods, bacteria near vents</li>
  </ul>
