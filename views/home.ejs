    <h2>Dive In And Learn!</h2>
    <p>
        The ocean is a vast, layered world divided into distinct zones, each shaped by changing light, temperature, and pressure. 
        From the bright and active Sunlit Zone at the surface to the crushing darkness of the Trenches miles below, every layer hosts unique ecosystems and extraordinary forms of life. 
        Explore each zone to discover how life adapts and thrives in this incredible underwater world.
