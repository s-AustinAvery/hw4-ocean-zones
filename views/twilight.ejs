    <h2>Twilight Zone (Mesopelagic Zone)</h2>
    <p>
        The Twilight Zone lies beneath the sunlit zone and does not receive strong sunlight. This section of the ocean dims to a pale blue. 
        Effective photosynthesis can no longer take place, and many creatures rely on drifting food from above or bioluminescence to survive. 
        Here the temperature drops significantly while the pressure rises. Life here becomes increasingly strange and specialized.
