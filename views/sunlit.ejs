    <h2>Sunlit Zone (Epipelagic Zone)</h2>
    <p>
        The Sunlit Zone is the warm upper layer of the ocean where sunlight fully penetrates.
        This is the most biologically active region of the ocean, where the majority of marine plants, fish, 
        and mammals reside. With plentful light and mild pressure, it is the part of the ocean most familiar to people.
